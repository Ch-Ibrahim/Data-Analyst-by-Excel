# Excel Data Analyst Project & Dashboard 

From my modest experience, I sum up the steps to follow for analyzing data using Excel  



1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources (e.g., databases, CSV files, web scraping).

2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, fill in missing values, and correct errors. You can use functions like `IFERROR`, `CLEAN`, and `TRIM` for this.

3. **Data Transformation**: Format the data for analysis. This can involve:
   - Converting data types (e.g., text to numbers).
   - Creating calculated fields with formulas.
   - Aggregating data (e.g., using `SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`).

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Use functions like `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `STDEV`, and `VAR` to summarize data.
   - **Pivot Tables**: Summarize and manipulate large datasets.
   - **Data Visualization**: Create charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to identify trends and patterns.

5. **Data Modeling**: Build predictive models using regression analysis or other statistical methods. Excel's `Analysis ToolPak` can be helpful here.

6. **Data Interpretation**: Draw insights from the analysis. Identify key findings and trends.

7. **Reporting**: Create dashboards and reports to present the findings. Use Excelâ€™s `Conditional Formatting`, `Slicers`, and `Charts` to make the data more understandable.

8. **Sharing Results**: Export the reports as PDFs or share the Excel file with stakeholders.
